# Linux-Arch

The way I use Linux.

Grab a live boot
Windows
Rufus
gpt
ext4
default settings
flash to usb
wait
boot the live with a machine
open terminal set passwd to something not off the top of your head it will read your mind
set firewall
connect to internet
install
disconnect internet
reboot
remove and set bios back to norm no need to secureboot
save and restart
remove usb
allow auto start or press power button
boot into install
uninstall ssh web based terminal and GUI wget, git it all uses http not https | whatever else.
reboot
remove ram get new stick unbuffered if possible | let sit 24 hrs or so to decharge ram, reinstall known good, new.
once installed boot
reset passwd and user pass
set firewall on reject public home office
skip if not needed | let die or unplug | battery then charge
let reset for 24hrs @ Random
power on
log in if not auto login
install said programs 
liveiso creation here, for faster install times 
rename and relocate bin
copy known good iso to wiped gpt ext4 usb
at this I have i3-wm just that, with auto launch of visual studio code
make sure you have a terminal open, and not using a file manager
move usr/bin and rename to new location
use terminal to use the new location keep random name and location every so often
use terminal with new location, be carefull once you close the terminal you will have to reinstall.
With the above only phisical use is really possible at this time it's all about up time.

at this time you should be able to install a microsoft edge broser, set settings to complete privacy and turn on the default vpn. install malware bytes, privacy badger, ublock, i don't care about cookies, i still don't care about cookies, grammerly
